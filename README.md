# BLE-Mouse-hacking

Extensive analysis was conducted using an nRF52840 Dongle as a sniffer to capture Bluetooth traffic for a mouse device. Various mouse actions such as left-click, right-click, and scrolling were mapped out, correlating them with specific packet values. Through repeated actions and scrutiny of packet sequences, fixed values for each action were confirmed. Transitioning to nRF Connect for Desktop BLE Standalone, changes in the Human Interface Device (HID) stack were identified, attempting to replicate mouse actions with altered values. Despite successful modification of attribute values, the output differed from authentic mouse behavior. Further investigation involved comparing Bluetooth packet sequences from the mouse with those of a LED bulb, aiming to discern patterns. Exploration also extended to the feasibility of emulating a Bluetooth mouse using an ESP32, potentially for a "mouse emulation attack" or "wireless mouse spoofing" scenario
